    "This data set contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all users receive the same offer, and that is the challenge to solve with this data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our task is to combine transaction, demographic and offer data to determine which demographic groups respond best to which offer type. This data set is a simplified version of the real Starbucks app because the underlying simulator only has one product whereas Starbucks actually sells dozens of products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every offer has a validity period before the offer expires. As an example, a BOGO offer might be valid for only 5 days. We'll see in the data set that informational offers have a validity period even though these ads are merely providing information about a product; for example, if an informational offer has 7 days of validity, we can assume the customer is feeling the influence of the offer for 7 days after receiving the advertisement.\n",

    "We'll use transactional data showing user purchases made on the app including the timestamp of purchase and the amount of money spent on a purchase.

There are also records for when a user completes an offer.\n",

    "However, there are a few things to watch out for in this data set. Customers do not opt into the offers that they receive; in other words, a user can receive an offer, never actually view the offer, and still complete the offer. For example, a user might receive the \"buy 10 dollars get 2 dollars off offer\", but the user never opens the offer during the 10 day validity period. The customer spends 15 dollars during those ten days. There will be an offer completion record in the data set; however, the customer was not influenced by the offer because the customer never viewed the offer.

    "We can see a large number of outliers here in the age column showing around 120 years of age. We could just use the median age to fill their values but the dataset would be imbalanced with most datapoints coming from the median age range. Since we only found 2175 ages over 115, we can safely delete them. We also found a pattern that all ages of 118 have a gender of `none` and income of `NaN`. This suggests to me there is an error with the data being input so it is useless to us even if we decided to impute the values."

A warning though, I have included a script which checks the data folder for a csv document of the `clean_data.csv` file so that it skips creating a new csv each time the notebook is restarted. This can be a problem if we want to see new changes reflected so we have to remember to delete the csv and restart the notebook again to have the changes saved. The `clean_data.csv` file takes aproximately 3 minutes to be created for me but it varies depending on the hardware used."

    "**Observation:** From this plot we can see the best performing model appears to be **XGBoost**, followed by **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest**. The differences are very small though. **KNN** was the fastest model to fit but also the took the longest to score by a large margin, the score times of the other models are extremely short. There seems to be a correlation between the length of time taken to fit the model and model performance as slower fitting models seem to perform better. The exception is **Random Forest** which takes the longest to fit but still ends up as the third-best performing model. From our findings, I would suggest continuing to refine the **XGBoost** model since it trains and performs the best of all the models.\n",
